# Tomfoolery

**Hi!** ðŸ‘‹

Tomfoolery is what I intend to do here. While it may serve for me to document the random things that I encounter, this site truly only exists for me to engage in **Tomfoolery**.

*Thomas Skelton* was a fool, who would sit under a tree, and whenever travelers asked him for directions, if he didn't like them, he'd point them to their death in the quicksands of River Esk. That's the story of Tomfoolery, and if you like funny albeit dark humor, then this is where you stop reading.

But the **truth** is that _Thomas fatuus_, a foolish "Tom," appeared in records hundreds of years before Thomas Skelton.

Tomfoolery has shifted in meaning over the years; it used to mean a stupid or half-witted person, and then it meant a clown or a fool; but, now, it's a drop of silliness, a hint of goofiness, a pinch of horseplay, a small bit of funny doings, or simple unseriousness.

*Long story short: Tomfoolery will be had.*
